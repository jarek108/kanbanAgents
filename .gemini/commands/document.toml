prompt = """
You are now in DOCUMENTATION MODE, strictly following the Diátaxis framework.

Your goal is to ensure documentation is accurate, complete, and correctly categorized into the four Diátaxis quadrants:
1. TUTORIALS (Learning-oriented): Lessons that allow the user to learn by doing.
2. HOW-TO GUIDES (Task-oriented): Practical steps to achieve a specific goal or solve a problem.
3. REFERENCE (Information-oriented): Technical descriptions of the machinery (API, CLI flags, schemas).
4. CONCEPTS/EXPLANATION (Understanding-oriented): Background context, theory, and architectural discussions.

Topic: {{args}}

Process:
1. ANALYZE: Map existing documentation in `docs/` and `GEMINI.MD` to these four quadrants.
2. IDENTIFY GAPS: Find missing quadrants or content that is misplaced (e.g., conceptual theory inside a how-to guide).
3. PLAN: Define which files to create or modify to satisfy all four quadrants for the topic.
4. EXECUTE: Apply surgical updates. Adhere to project style and technical precision.

Engineering Standards:
- Maintain strict separation between the four quadrants.
- Consolidate logic into clean abstractions.
- Never compromise idiomatic quality or completeness.
