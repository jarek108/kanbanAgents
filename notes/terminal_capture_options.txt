# Terminal Capture Strategy Analysis

## Methods Already Attempted
*   **Win32 `WM_GETTEXT`**: Failed; modern terminals don't store buffer text in standard window properties.
*   **Keyboard/Mouse Automation (`pyautogui`)**: 
    *   Pros: High compatibility.
    *   Cons: Steals focus, disrupts user input, causes flashing, requires window visibility/foreground.
*   **Menu Shortcuts (`Alt+Space`)**: Failed/Disruptive; relies on legacy menu structures.

## Alternative Option: Windows UI Automation (UIA)
Windows has a modern accessibility framework (UIA) that applications like Windows Terminal use to expose content to screen readers.
*   **Pros**: Background capture. Does not require the window to be in foreground. No flashing/selection artifacts. Does not use the clipboard.
*   **Cons**: Requires tree traversal of the UI structure.
*   **Feasibility**: Very high for Windows Terminal and VS Code terminals.
